# Lab sample Labels

This repo contains some code to make sample labels with a barcode
suitable for printing on
the [TTLW-2016](http://divbio.com/lasertough-tags128x0502125pk.aspx)
label format (See `sample_labels.tex`).

If additional projects use this code, we'll either fork it into
branches, or make it more general.
